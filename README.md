# Cascade

Inspired by twynsicle's [Cascade](https://github.com/twynsicle/Cascade), this app will help a user track good habits
over periods of time. The client-side code is written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/).
The server side is Node JS using Express, with a MongoDB data store.

## What will make this app different from other habit-tracking apps?

Most habit-tracking apps tend to track by a calendar, with tasks occurring every day, every other day, every weekday,
or X times per calendar week. Sometimes one would prefer to track a habit that should be done once every X days, rather
than "every Monday, Wednesday and Friday," for example. Cascade will keep track of your habits as a continuous flow of
days instead of breaking them up by calendar weeks and months.

## Examples of Cascade tasks

* Exercise for 20 minutes 5 times per 7-day period
* Get 8 hours of sleep per night
* Balance budget once every 4 weeks
* Feed the cat once every 12 hours

## Leveling up

At any time you can Level Up a task to make it harder or closer to your ultimate goal. Cascade will visually reflect the
task's higher level so that you can feel a greater sense of accomplishment as you level up your tasks. Other tasks will
naturally not have levels, but they are still part of the flow of your life, so Cascade will consider them to be just as
important.

## Work in progress

Cascade is not finished. It is barely even started. We aren't even up to version 0.1. I just wanted to keep track of the
app from its bare-bones beginnings and see how far I can get. Once the app actually does something, this readme will
contain instructions for running it.
